"1","1What is the main purpose of a simple machine?","1To make work easier by changing the force or direction of the effort."
"2","2How does an inclined plane reduce the amount of force needed?","2It spreads the required force over a longer distance."
"3","3What are the six types of simple machines?","3Inclined plane, wedge, screw, lever, pulley, and wheel and axle."
"4","4How does a lever work to move a heavy object?","4It uses a rigid bar that pivots on a fulcrum to multiply force."
"5","5What is a real-world example of a first-class lever?","5A seesaw, where the fulcrum is between the effort and the load."
"6","6How does a wheel and axle help make work easier?","6It reduces friction and allows easier movement or lifting of loads."
"7","7What type of simple machine is a knife and how does it work?","7A wedge; it splits objects apart by concentrating force to a narrow edge."
"8","8How does a pulley system make lifting heavy objects easier?","8It changes the direction of force and can multiply the force with more pulleys."
"9","9What is mechanical advantage in the context of simple machines?","9It is the ratio of output force to input force, showing how much a machine multiplies effort."
"10","10How can a screw be considered a simple machine?","10It is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, converting rotational force into linear motion."
"11","11What is the relationship between effort distance and force in simple machines?","11The longer the effort distance, the less force is needed to do the same work."
"12","12What is a real-world example of a wheel and axle?","12A doorknob, where turning the knob (wheel) turns the shaft (axle)."
"13","13What is the difference between a single fixed pulley and a movable pulley?","13A fixed pulley only changes direction, while a movable pulley reduces the effort needed."
"14","14Why is a ramp considered an inclined plane?","14It allows heavy loads to be moved upward more easily over a longer distance."
"15","15How does increasing the length of a lever arm affect the effort needed?","15It decreases the effort needed to lift a load."
"16","16What is a compound machine?","16A machine made of two or more simple machines working together."
"17","17How do simple machines affect energy use?","17They do not reduce the total amount of work but make it easier by changing how it is done."
"18","18What role does friction play in the efficiency of simple machines?","18Friction reduces efficiency by converting some input energy into heat."
"19","19How is a wedge similar to an inclined plane?","19Both are sloped surfaces, but a wedge moves through objects while an inclined plane stays stationary."
"20","20What is an example of a compound machine that includes a lever and a wheel and axle?","20A wheelbarrow, which uses both to lift and move loads with less effort."
