"1","What is the main purpose of a simple machine?","To make work easier by changing the force or direction of the effort."
"2","How does an inclined plane reduce the amount of force needed?","It spreads the required force over a longer distance."
"3","What are the six types of simple machines?","Inclined plane, wedge, screw, lever, pulley, and wheel and axle."
"4","How does a lever work to move a heavy object?","It uses a rigid bar that pivots on a fulcrum to multiply force."
"5","What is a real-world example of a first-class lever?","A seesaw, where the fulcrum is between the effort and the load."
"6","How does a wheel and axle help make work easier?","It reduces friction and allows easier movement or lifting of loads."
"7","What type of simple machine is a knife and how does it work?","A wedge; it splits objects apart by concentrating force to a narrow edge."
"8","How does a pulley system make lifting heavy objects easier?","It changes the direction of force and can multiply the force with more pulleys."
"9","What is mechanical advantage in the context of simple machines?","It is the ratio of output force to input force, showing how much a machine multiplies effort."
"10","How can a screw be considered a simple machine?","It is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, converting rotational force into linear motion."
"11","What is the relationship between effort distance and force in simple machines?","The longer the effort distance, the less force is needed to do the same work."
"12","What is a real-world example of a wheel and axle?","A doorknob, where turning the knob (wheel) turns the shaft (axle)."
"13","What is the difference between a single fixed pulley and a movable pulley?","A fixed pulley only changes direction, while a movable pulley reduces the effort needed."
"14","Why is a ramp considered an inclined plane?","It allows heavy loads to be moved upward more easily over a longer distance."
"15","How does increasing the length of a lever arm affect the effort needed?","It decreases the effort needed to lift a load."
"16","What is a compound machine?","A machine made of two or more simple machines working together."
"17","How do simple machines affect energy use?","They do not reduce the total amount of work but make it easier by changing how it is done."
"18","What role does friction play in the efficiency of simple machines?","Friction reduces efficiency by converting some input energy into heat."
"19","How is a wedge similar to an inclined plane?","Both are sloped surfaces, but a wedge moves through objects while an inclined plane stays stationary."
"20","What is an example of a compound machine that includes a lever and a wheel and axle?","A wheelbarrow, which uses both to lift and move loads with less effort."
