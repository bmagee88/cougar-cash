each time you make it to 100% you get a randomized woodland themed sprite walking around your calm space.
there is a rarity for each of the items.
When you begin and lose you lose on of your items.  Its especially gonna hurt if you lose a rare one.
now, the thing is.  when you lose the items they dont really lose.  they transform.  and with each dive into anxiety,
each of the items transform.
a seedling will grow to a sapling, a sampling into a small tree.. then to a big one.
if a tree falls (you lose it) it decays and you get a chance to gain new items like mushrooms.
if an animal dies it attracts a new animal.
etc etc.
